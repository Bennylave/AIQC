Mission
*******

* **Accelerating Research at Universities & Institutes Everywhere.**
  
  * We empower non-cloud users: the academic/ institute HPCers, the private clouders, the remote server SSH'ers, and everyday desktop hackers - with the same quality ML tooling as present in public clouds (e.g. AWS SageMaker). This toolset provides research teams a standardized method for ML-based evidence, rather than each researcher spending time cobbling together their own approach.

* **Reproducible Experiments.**
  
  * No more black boxes. No more screenshotting loss-accuracy graphs and hyperparameter combinations. A record of every: dataset, feature, label, sample, split, fold, parameter, model, training job, and result - is automatically persisted in a lightweight, file-based database that is automatically configured when you import the package. Submit your *aidb* database file alongside your publications/ papers and model zoo entries as a proof.

* **Queue Hypertuning Jobs.**
  
  * Design a batch of runs to test many hypotheses at once. Queue many hypertuning jobs locally, or delegate big jobs to the cloud to run in parallel by setting `cloud_queue = True`.

* **Visually Compare Performance Metrics.**
  
  * Compare models using pre-defined plots for assessing performance, including: quantitative metrics (e.g. accuracy, loss, variance, precision, recall, etc.), training histories, and confusion/ contingency matrices.

* **Code-Integrated & Agnostic.**

  * We donâ€™t disrupt the natural workflow of data scientists by forcing them into the confines of a GUI app or specific IDE. Instead, we weave automated tracking into their existing scripts so that *AIQC* is compatible with any data science toolset.

*Lend a hand in building the next generation of open source machine learning, or just talk shop.*

ML is a broad space with plenty of challenges to solve. Let us know if you want to get involved. We plan to host monthly dev jam sessions and data science lightning talks. It's more fun to hack in a group.

Don't know machine learning? It's easy, we'll teach you.
