Why Does AIQC Exist?
********************

Deep learning has the power to accelerate scientific discoveries by acting as a torch that reveals the laws of nature through data-driven pattern recognition.

Earth's natural resources are being destroyed, and it's beyond our current capabilities to repair the environment. In order to survive here and elsewhere, we need to make major advances in non-linear fields like: synthetic biology to heal the earth and small-scale nuclear power to fuel its progress. We can't physically transport 10 billion people off of this planet.

1. To expedite Earth-saving scientific discoveries.
===================================================
  
  * Make deep learning more *accessible to researchers* by reducing the amount of *programming and data science know-how* required to perform deep learning. This unattainable skillset trifecta causes machine learning to be underutilized in science.
  * Provide field-specific deep learning solutions for science in the form of: pipelines for preprocessing scientific file formats, pre-trained models for transfer learning, and visualizations of predictions. 
  

2. To bring the scientific method to data science.
==================================================

  * Make machine learning *less of a black box* by implementing a "Quality control (QC)" protocols comprised of best practice validation rules.
  * Reproducibly record not only the machine learning experiments, but also the lineage for preparing data. An AIQC file should be submitted alongside publications and model zoo entries as a *proof*.
  * This toolset provides research teams a *standardized method for ML-based evidence*, rather than each researcher spending time cobbling together their own approach.


3. To break down walled gardens - science should be open.
=========================================================

  * The majority of research doesn't happen in the cloud, it's performed on the personal computers of individuals. We *empower the non-cloud researchers*: the academic/ institute HPCers, the remote server SSH'ers, and everyday desktop warriors.
  * It's going to take *all of us* to overcome the challenges that we are currently faced with, so *we should all have access to the best tools.* What would Newton have discovered with the power of deep learning?
