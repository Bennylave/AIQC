### Overview

* AIQC is an open source Python framework that brings reproducible deep learning workflows to open science.

  * Mission = empower open science: [1] Reduce the programming & data science know-how required to adopt deep learning. [2] Automatically record experiment workflows. [3] Provide a free alternative to expensive cloud SaaS & walled gardens. [4] Accelerate Earth-healing discoveries.

  * Tech = easy-to-use Python package: [1] Provide best-practice guardrails in the form of an object-oriented API (e.g. Label, Hyperparamset, Job). [2] Simplify preprocessing and batch model tuning/ scoring. [3] Prevent data leakage and evaluation bias. [4] Persist experimental design in a SQLite database file.
