### Overview

* **AIQC is an open source Python framework for rapid & reproducible deep learning.**

  * **Mission** - empower open science by: *[1]* Reducing the programming & data science know-how required to adopt deep learning. *[2]* Automatically recording experiment workflows. *[3]* Providing a free alternative to expensive clouds & walled gardens.

  * **Tech** - a Python package that provides best-practice guardrails in the form of an object-oriented API (e.g. Label, Hyperparamset, Job) that not only: *[1]* Accelerates preprocessing and batch model tuning/ scoring but also *[2]* Prevents data leakage and evaluation bias.
